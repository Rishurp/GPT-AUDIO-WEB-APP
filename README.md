# Mercor-GPT-AUDIO-WEB-APP-Assignment

This is an assignment that involves creating a voice-controlled chatbot using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend.

## Frontend

The frontend code is written in React and uses the following dependencies:

- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `react-speech-recognition`: A library for speech recognition in React.
- `axios`: A library for making HTTP requests.
- `artyom.js`: A JavaScript library for voice control.

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
3. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Backend

The backend code is written in Express.js and interacts with the OpenAI API to generate chatbot responses.

To run the backend, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the backend server by running `node index.js`.
3. The backend server will be listening on port 8800.

Make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your backend server's environment to the correct OpenAI API key.

That's it! You should now have a working voice-controlled chatbot application.
